# Categorical-KG

Category theory has been heavily applied in knowledge representation, especially in database theory, cf. [categoricaldata.net](https://www.categoricaldata.net). Can categorical-KR be useful in computation with knowledge graphs (KG), in particular for KG embeddings and alignment? 

Relevant literature - 
1. [Ologs: a categorical framework for knowledge representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1889) - by David I. Spivak, Robert E. Kent. 
  - Hallmark paper in categorical-KR, which leads to [categoricaldata.net](https://www.categoricaldata.net). 
2. [Lattice-preserving $\mathcal{ALC}$ ontology embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07163) by Fernando Zhapa-Camacho, Robert Hoehndorf 
  - Uses categorical formulation of description logics for lattice preserving ontology embeddings. 
3. Categorical formulations of Description Logics
  - [Category-theoretical Semantics of the Description Logic ALC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08837) by Chan Le Duc
  - [Reasoning in the Description Logic ALC under Category Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04911) by Ludovic Brieulle, Chan Le Duc, Pascal Vaillant.
4. [Knowledge Representation in Bicategories of Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00526) by Evan Patterson
  - introduces _relational ontology logs_ which possess several useful features not possessed by most description logics, such as a type system and a rich, flexible notion of instance data.

\[**Precisely**, how do KGs rely on DLs?\]
\
\[Review of [this primer](https://github.com/turing-knowledge-graphs/teaching/tree/main/city) on semantic web technologies and KGs is underway\]

Idea: Can categorical logic or topos logic (like with suboject classifier in $\mathcal{C}$-**Inst**) be useful in KG computations? \[add further explanation of idea\]. 

\[Broader concept: CT for neurosymbolic AI\].
